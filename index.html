                        The Great Barrier Reef is the largest living structure
                        in the world. It expands as big as 344,000 km2. Not only
                        that, it holds the record of the largest coral reef in
                        the world. Many fish live in the Great Barrier Reef such
                        as 100 species of jellyfish, 3000 types of mollusks,
                        1625 types of fish, 133 varieties of sharks and rays,
                        and 30+ species of whales and dolphins. However, the
                        Great Barrier Reef is very vulnerable and sensitive.

                        Due to the sensitivity of the reef, many tourists aren't
                        allowed to visit the reef. Climate change is a major
                        factor in the growth of the reef. Over 95% of Coral
                        Bleaching has occurred since 1995.

            <p style="color: #4E4E4E;">The Great Barrier reef has lost almost 50 percent of its corals since 1985 due to climate change. At this rate, there will be no more "Great Barrier Reef" by 2050. According to Linwood et al. (2019), "results from laboratory, field and model studies converge to show that we can expect OA (Oceanic Acidification), particularly in combination with warming, to cause major changes in GBR (Great Barrier Reef) communities, including loss of reef framework, biodiversity and ecosystem services. While warming remains the most 'acute concern for the GBR, with mass bleaching events expected to continue in the years to come." Based on this evidence, we can expect that climate change is ruining the reef through its Oceanic Acidification (Coral Bleaching).

                <div style="width: 70%; display: table-cell;"> <p style="color: #4E4E4E;">Coral Reefs play a giant role in our ocean's ecosystem by serving as a guard, home, and food rich for species living there. Not only that, it protects the land surrounding the reef by minimizing waves/tropical storms. According to the Natural History Museum, "More than 500 million people worldwide depend on reefs for food, jobs, and coastal defense. The ridges in coral reefs act as barriers and can reduce wave energy by up to 97%, providing crucial protection from threats such as tsunamis" (Natural Museum Of History, 2021).</div>

            <p>WFF stated that "pollution has caused deadly starfish outbreaks, and global warming has produced horrific coral bleaching" (WWF Australia). The Great Barrier Reef has affected other ecosystems due to its high pollution levels, leading to massive and deadly starfish outbreaks. These outbreaks allow for many endangered species to go extinct. Plus, the consistent pollution affects the reef due to it getting latched or eaten by fish. All of these effects dive into other important ecosystems under and over water leading to their destruction. This can be prevented through net-zero emissions, less pollution, and more care from the community and the wealthy!
            </p>
            <p>
              The Great Barrier Reef also has many effects on tourists and the local community. Knowing that coral bleaching has been affecting over 50% of the reef, tourists are losing interest in visiting such a beautiful piece of land. Many diving sites will be shut down because of the lack of business. Not only that, since the reef is slowly being destroyed, the shore will not be as well protected from large waves and tropical storms.

            <p style="color: #4E4E4E;" class="pt-4 pt-md-0">The Great Barrier Reef is a very important part of our earth (especially Australia). However, due to the rapid increase in global warming, CNN states, "on closer examination, the story loses some of its beauty. The reef -- along with the multibillion-dollar tourist industry it supports -- could be extinct by 2050" (Abitbol, 2017). It would be a great tragedy to lose such an important and beautiful reef. It won’t just be the reef we would lose due to climate change. Many other important landmarks and ecosystems are being challenged every day by the change in the climate. For example, WFF reportedly said that “Even if we significantly curb emissions in the coming decades, more than a third of the world’s remaining glaciers will melt before the year 2100. When it comes to sea ice, 95% of the oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic is already gone.” Overall, climate change has ruined many parts of our earth, and it would be a tragedy to lose more.

              The major factors to the death of coral reefs today are pollution, coral bleaching, and invasive species. A few ways of removing pollution in the water would be by not littering or taking advantage of non-profits such as TeamSeas. We can also remove invasive species through hunting. When scuba diving, many people bring tools to catch lionfish (an invasive species found everywhere around the world) in order to remove them collectively. Finally, coral bleaching can be stopped by decreasing our carbon footprint on the atmosphere.
